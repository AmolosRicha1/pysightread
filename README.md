# pysightread
I wrote some code which I hope is the starting of a programm, which can be used to display pressed notes from the e-piano on the staff and can be used to learn to sight read with linux. 
For this task I wrote a python3 programm which uses pyqt5 as gui. I modelled a staff with blender. The pythonprogramm uses rtmidi to be able to connect from qjackctl (jackd).


Here is an example of the Programm and how it looks like at the moment

To start the Program just do python3 MainPrg.py. But you will need all the required Modules and packages. Please view the Readme-Folder for additional information.
